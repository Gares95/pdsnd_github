### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project contains a python program that allows the user to explore data related to a bike share system for some cities in the United States.

The program will start by asking the user to choose which city does he or she want to explore the data from (this version of the program includes an "All" option to combine all the data from all the cities to obtain more wide information which include these three cities).
After that, the user will be able to filter by day of the week or by month, and the program will return data related to:
 - Most frequent times of travel.
 - Most used bike stations.
 - Data about the trip duration.
 - Data about the users.

### Files used
Files:
 - **bikeshare.py**: The python program
 - **data**: Directory that contains the cvs files with the data.
 - **README**: File that contains the description of the functionality of the program and the contents of the files.

### Credits
